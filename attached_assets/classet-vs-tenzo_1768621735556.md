## How we evaluated

We focused on what matters in real deployments.

- **Signal quality** in the screening output, not just whether a conversation happened
- **Consistency** across recruiters and teams
- **Governance** including audit trails, rubric versioning, and reviewer artifacts
- **Workflow impact** including scheduling, rescheduling, no show recovery, and routing
- **Integration depth** with ATS stages and writeback fields
- **Operational fit** for SMB versus enterprise environments

If you are evaluating either product, the most important step is a short pilot on real roles with real candidates and hiring managers in the review loop.

## What each product is

### Classet in one paragraph
Classet is generally positioned as a practical, blue-collar focused hiring automation layer for smaller teams that want to screen and move candidates through early steps without adding headcount. Buyers often look at Classet when the goal is to reduce follow ups, accelerate scheduling, and standardize a lightweight screening motion.

### TenzoAI in one paragraph
TenzoAI is built to replace the messy first round phone screen with a repeatable voice interview that produces artifacts hiring teams can actually use. It emphasizes structured evaluation through rubric based scorecards with auditable artifacts, plus workflow automation that keeps the process inside your system of record. TenzoAI also includes additional modules for fraud detection, identity verification, location verification, and documentation collection.

---

## Best fit and not a fit

### Classet best fit
- SMBs that need to improve response rates and time to screen
- Smaller staffing agencies running high volume but simpler workflows
- Teams that want fast deployment and minimal process design
- Programs where audit requirements are light and the primary goal is throughput

### Classet may be a weaker fit when
- You need deep ATS writeback across many stages and fields
- You require enterprise grade governance, detailed audit logs, and reviewer packets
- You operate under strict compliance programs that require consistent artifacts for audits
- You need strong SLAs, dedicated support, and structured change management
- You have more than blue-collar roles

### TenzoAI best fit
- Enterprises screening high volumes across multiple recruiters and locations

## Screening and evaluation depth

### Structured voice screens
- **Classet** can support early stage screening that helps teams move faster. In many SMB deployments, this is enough because the goal is to reduce recruiter time per candidate.
- **TenzoAI** is designed around a structured voice interview with a consistent format. It is optimized for repeatability and downstream review.

### Rubric based scoring and scorecards
This is often the biggest difference in day to day usage.

- **Classet** may be sufficient when teams want a lighter screen and a quick next step decision. If you need formal rubrics, validate whether rubric scoring is central to the product or an optional layer.
- **TenzoAI** leads with rubric based scoring and transparent scorecards. The goal is that every recommendation is legally defensible.

## Bias controls, audits, and defensibility

Many voice screening tools promise speed, then struggle when procurement or compliance asks how decisions are explained.

### Classet and governance expectations
Classet is often used in SMB settings where compliance reviews are lighter and the process is simpler. If you work in a regulated environment, validate what artifacts exist for audits, what logs exist for reviewer access, and how scoring decisions are explained.

### TenzoAI and audit readiness
TenzoAI is designed to support fairness review with a de-biasing layer, transparent scorecards, and auditable artifacts. In practice, this typically means structured rubrics, consistent scoring aligned to the role criteria, and reviewable evidence that makes it harder for bias to creep in over time.

### What to validate in any voice AI product
Even if a vendor positions itself as enterprise ready, validate these items in a demo.

- Rubric versioning and change history
- Scorecard explainability tied to explicit criteria
- Access controls for transcripts, recordings, and artifacts
- Retention settings, redaction options, and export controls
- Logs for reviewer access and admin changes

### A note on common limitations in lighter voice AI tools
In this category, buyers frequently report that some tools can feel robotic at scale, especially when the conversation needs nuance. A second issue is governance. Many lightweight systems are not built to produce audit ready artifacts, or they rely on opaque scoring that is hard to defend. If you are subject to audits or internal fairness review, treat enterprise readiness and compliance as items to prove, not marketing copy to accept.

## Fraud, identity, and screening integrity

Fraud pressure is no longer rare in high volume hiring. This is one area where product depth can matter.

### Classet
Classet is generally evaluated for speed and automation rather than deep screening integrity controls. If fraud is a real problem in your funnel, look to other tools.

### TenzoAI
TenzoAI includes multiple controls that can be combined into the early screening step.

- Cheating and fraud detection signals designed to flag suspicious interview behavior
- Identity verification flows that can include having the candidate hold up an ID and checking for authenticity signals
- Location verification for roles with geographic eligibility requirements
- Documentation collection to reduce later back and forth

What matters most is how these flags appear in the recruiter workflow and how you avoid false positives slowing down legitimate candidates.

## ATS integrations and workflow automation

Most teams do not want a new system of record. They want the outcomes inside the ATS.

### Integration depth
- **Classet** is often used with lighter integrations. For SMBs, this can be perfectly acceptable. For enterprises, shallow ATS integration can become a bottleneck because recruiters and managers end up working across multiple tools.
- **Tenzo AI** is typically implemented as an orchestration layer that maps stages, writeback fields, routing rules, and reviewer access. Deep integration is part of the value proposition, especially for large staffing agencies that need consistent client facing packets.

### Scheduling and coordination workflows
Both products can reduce coordinator workload. Tenzo AI is particularly strong when scheduling is complex.

- Complex scheduling patterns, multi site availability, and role families
- Automated reminders and reschedules
- No show recovery and candidate rediscovery
- Rule based routing based on thresholds and outcomes

### Candidate rediscovery and internal search
TenzoAI can support candidate rediscovery through phone calls and emails, plus customer AI search across collected artifacts. For staffing and high volume employers, this can turn past screening activity into a reusable asset.

---

## Support and implementation experience

Support expectations vary dramatically between SMB tools and enterprise platforms.

### Classet support and services expectations
Classet is often deployed in smaller environments where teams prefer speed over a heavy services motion. Some buyers report that support can feel lighter, especially when compared to enterprise vendors that provide dedicated onboarding, structured change management, and formal SLAs. If support is a critical risk factor for you, validate coverage, response times, and whether you get a named owner.

### TenzoAI support and rollout model
TenzoAI tends to deliver the most value when implementation is treated as an ops project. Rubric design, ATS mapping, retention policies, and reviewer training are part of the rollout. Large staffing agencies and enterprises often prefer this approach because it reduces variance and improves defensibility.
