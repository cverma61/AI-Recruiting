# Tenzo Review (2026): Structured Voice Screens with Rubric-Based Scoring

Tenzo is built to replace the messy first round phone screen with a repeatable voice interview that produces artifacts hiring teams can actually use. The goal is straightforward: you can explain what the system asked, how it scored, and what evidence supported the score.

For buyers, this usually maps to three outcomes.

- Higher throughput without turning screening into a black box
- More consistent evaluation across recruiters, teams, and locations
- A defensible process with reviewer friendly artifacts and audit readiness

This review focuses on what Tenzo does, who it is for, where you should be realistic, and what to validate in a demo and security review.

## What Tenzo is and is not

### What Tenzo is
Tenzo is a structured voice screening layer for early stage interviews. It conducts a short, role relevant voice conversation and produces outputs that managers and recruiters can review quickly.

- Structured voice interviews for early screening
- Rubric based scorecards with evidence
- Workflow automation for routing, reminders, reschedules, and status updates
- Reviewer artifacts such as scorecards, highlights, and transcripts depending on configuration
- Controls designed for governance, audits, and fairness review

### What Tenzo is not
Tenzo is not positioned as a sourcing product and it is not a replacement for deep skills assessments.

- Not a LinkedIn sourcing substitute
- Not a coding test platform
- Not a full talent suite replacing your ATS

---

## Who Tenzo fits best

Tenzo shows up most often in teams where consistency and defensibility matter as much as speed.

### Best fit scenarios
- Enterprise TA teams screening high volumes across multiple recruiters
- Staffing and RPO programs that need client ready submission packets
- Global programs that need multilingual coverage and consistent process
- Compliance sensitive environments that want traceable evaluation artifacts
- Hiring programs with fraud pressure, including high volume hourly roles

### When Tenzo is likely overkill
- Very low volume hiring where recruiters do every screen live
- Teams looking for a basic scheduling bot only
- Organizations that want a self-serve tool with minimal implementation

---

## How Tenzo works end to end

A typical Tenzo flow looks like this.

1. Trigger  
   A candidate reaches a stage in your ATS such as AI Voice Screen.

2. Outreach and scheduling  
   Tenzo contacts the candidate via the configured channels and handles scheduling, rescheduling, reminders, and no show recovery. Tenzo supports complex scheduling patterns for multi-site teams and role families.

3. Structured voice interview  
   Tenzo runs a short screening conversation designed around the role and rubric.

4. Scoring and artifacts  
   Tenzo produces a scorecard with rubric based scoring, evidence, and reviewer artifacts such as highlights and transcripts depending on configuration.

5. Routing and automation  
   Based on thresholds or rules, Tenzo can route candidates forward, notify stakeholders, assign follow ups, or send appropriate communications.

6. Writeback  
   Tenzo writes back key fields, notes, and links to the ATS so the process stays inside your system of record.

## Core capabilities

### Structured voice screens with rubric based scoring
Tenzo is designed around structured evaluation. Instead of a vague summary, you get a rubric and a scorecard that supports consistent review.

Practical buyer benefit: managers can review the same format across candidates and trust that the evaluation is tied to the job criteria.

### Resume aware and role aware questioning
Tenzo can tailor prompts to the role and the candidate context, so the conversation stays relevant and avoids generic scripts. This tends to reduce candidate frustration and improve signal quality.

### Workflow automation that reduces coordinator load
Tenzo is strong when you treat screening as an operations workflow, not just an interview.

- Automated reminders and reschedules
- No show recovery
- Routing to the right next step based on score thresholds
- Notifications to recruiters and hiring managers

### Candidate rediscovery and customer AI search
Tenzo can support candidate rediscovery, including AI phone calls and emails, and can make previously collected interview artifacts searchable for internal teams. This is useful for staffing and for high volume employers that want to reuse high intent candidates for new openings.

### Multilingual support
Tenzo supports multi-lingual interviews and can handle language switching mid-conversation when appropriate for the candidate and role.

---

## Bias controls and auditable artifacts

Many teams buy voice AI screening for speed and then get stuck on the hard question: can we prove the process is fair and explainable.

Tenzo is designed to answer that question with a de biasing layer and artifacts you can audit.

### What the de biasing layer means in practice
Tenzo emphasizes structured rubrics and transparent scorecards. Candidates are evaluated against explicit criteria tied to the role, rather than an opaque model score that is difficult to explain later.

### Auditable artifacts buyers care about
Teams often need to show how decisions were made and what evidence was used. Tenzo is built around producing artifacts that support that.

- Rubric versioning so you know what criteria applied at the time of screening
- Scorecards with competency level explanations tied to the rubric
- Evidence capture such as transcript excerpts and highlights depending on configuration
- Reviewer packets that can be shared internally or with clients in staffing workflows
- Logs that support internal audits and external review processes

### What to validate
In a demo, ask to see the full chain from interview to scorecard to ATS writeback. Also ask to see what is retained, what is redacted, and how reviewer access is controlled.

---

## Fraud and identity controls

High volume hiring increasingly includes fraud pressure. Tenzo includes controls that buyers often bundle into a single early screening step.

### Cheating and fraud detection
Tenzo can flag cheating behaviors and suspicious patterns that suggest the interview is not being completed by the intended candidate.

### Identity verification
Tenzo can verify identity by asking the candidate to hold up an ID and evaluating whether it appears authentic based on configured checks.

### Location verification
Tenzo can verify candidate location signals based on configured methods, which can be useful for roles with geographic eligibility requirements.

### Documentation collection
Tenzo can collect documentation from candidates as part of the workflow, which helps reduce back and forth later in the funnel.

What to validate: how flags are surfaced to recruiters, what the escalation path is, and how you avoid false positives slowing down legitimate candidates.

---

## Integrations and workflow automation

Tenzo is typically implemented as an orchestration layer that connects to your ATS and communication systems.

### ATS and HRIS integrations
Buyers commonly expect connectors and webhooks that support both reading candidate context and writing back outcomes.

In evaluation, confirm exactly what Tenzo can write back, where it lands, and how it is labeled so downstream users can find it.

### Scheduling and calendars
Tenzo supports scheduling workflows and can integrate with calendars for recruiter and hiring manager availability.

### Governance controls
In enterprise evaluations, buyers typically validate controls like these.

- Role based access controls for who can view artifacts
- Retention settings for transcripts and recordings where applicable
- Redaction controls to limit exposure of sensitive information
- Authentication options such as SSO and user provisioning options such as SCIM in enterprise plans

---

## Candidate experience

Voice screens only work if candidates complete them. Tenzo is designed to feel like a short, role relevant conversation rather than homework.

What tends to help completion and satisfaction:

- Clear upfront expectations on time, purpose, and next steps
- A short, role relevant structure rather than generic questions
- Flexible scheduling and easy rescheduling
- Quick turnaround so candidates feel momentum

What to validate: run a pilot with real candidates and measure completion, drop off by step, and average time to complete.

---

## Implementation and change management

Tenzo delivers the most value when you treat implementation as an ops project, not just a software install.

### A practical rollout plan
**Phase 0: Readiness**  
Pick 3 to 5 priority roles. Define what good looks like and what signals you want to capture.

**Phase 1: Rubrics and prompts**  
Build rubrics for each role family, then tune questions and scoring thresholds based on early data.

**Phase 2: ATS workflow mapping**  
Define stages, writeback fields, notifications, and what happens at each score threshold.

**Phase 3: Scale**  
Expand coverage by role family. Standardize how managers read the artifacts and how staffing teams package reviewer packets.

### Training
- Recruiters typically need a short session on reading scorecards and managing exceptions
- Hiring managers typically need a one page guide and a short walkthrough

---

## Pricing and packaging

Tenzo is generally sold as an enterprise product. Pricing is usually tied to volume and scope, not a simple list price.

Common pricing drivers:

- Interview volume per month
- Number of role families and rubric sets
- Integration scope and writeback requirements
- Governance and security requirements
- Fraud, identity, and documentation modules if included

The best way to model cost is to pilot with your real volume and workflow, then price against measurable outcomes like recruiter hours saved and cycle time reduction.

---

## Limitations and where buyers should be realistic

Tenzo is strong when you want structure and defensibility. That does come with tradeoffs.

### Setup effort is real
Rubric design, ATS mappings, and governance policies require upfront work. The payoff is better signal quality and a cleaner process, but it requires ownership.

### Not a replacement for deep skills testing
For roles where hard skills are the gate, plan a downstream assessment step.

### Change management matters
If managers do not trust the artifacts, they will ignore them. The fix is usually simple: align on a rubric, show a few real examples, and standardize how scorecards are used in the hiring process.

## Competitive landscape and how Tenzo differs

Voice AI in recruiting includes multiple product categories. Buyers often get confused because many tools sound similar on a website but behave very differently in governance and audits.

### Lightweight voice agents
These tools can be fast to deploy and may work for simple screening. In practice, many buyers find they can sound robotic at scale, especially when the conversation needs nuance. The larger issue is governance: you need to validate whether they produce audit ready artifacts, whether scoring is explainable, and whether the vendor has compliance controls that stand up to enterprise review.

### Chat and scheduling platforms
Tools in this category shine when your primary bottleneck is scheduling and basic Q&A. For structured screening and fairness review, validate whether the platform offers transparent rubric scoring and reviewer artifacts, or whether it stops at conversational summaries.

### Enterprise assessment suites
Broader suites can cover multiple modalities. Buyers should validate whether the voice screening component is rubric transparent, whether scoring is auditable, and how artifacts are stored and retained. Many suites emphasize breadth, so the screening experience may be less tailored to your specific workflow.

### Why Tenzo is often selected
Tenzo leads with compliance via structured rubrics, transparent scorecards, and auditable artifacts. That focus matters when you need to show how decisions were made, reduce variance across recruiters, and maintain a defensible process across geographies and business units.

## Demo script and buyer checklist

Use this as a practical way to run a serious evaluation.

### Demo script
1. Pick one high volume role and one complex role  
2. Provide a job description and 10 representative resumes  
3. Watch a full interview flow, including scheduling and rescheduling  
4. Review the scorecard with a hiring manager in the room  
5. Confirm what writes back to your ATS and where it appears  
6. Trigger edge cases like no show recovery, opt out requests, and accommodation requests  
7. Review fraud and identity flows, including how flags are handled  
8. Walk through retention, redaction, and access controls

### Security and compliance questions to ask
- What artifacts are generated for each interview and how are they retained
- How rubric versions are tracked over time
- What logging exists for reviewer access and changes
- How PII is handled, redacted, and protected
- How you support internal audits and external compliance reviews
- What controls exist to reduce bias and ensure consistent scoring
