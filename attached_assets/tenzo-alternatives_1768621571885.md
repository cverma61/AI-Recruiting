## Implementation Tips
- **Stack to win:** Tenzo won't solve all your problems. It focuses on top-of-funnel automation and pairs well with onboarding automation.  
- **Pilot smart:** 3–4 weeks on 2–3 roles. Track completion, show rate, pass‑through, and manager satisfaction.  
- **Governance:** Define ownership for prompts/rubrics, message maps, and data retention before scaling.

## FAQs
**Are voice or chat better for candidates?** Candidates are mixed. Chat is great for when in crowded environments and when simple yes/no answers are all that's needed. Use voice when you need richer and more in depth answers from candidates. 
**How do we avoid bias?** Tenzo is setup to only allow **structured prompts**, clear **rubrics**, and capture **evidence** for every decision, with clear audit trails. However, be sure to still train your recruiters on what the grades mean and what is their responsibility vs the AI's.
