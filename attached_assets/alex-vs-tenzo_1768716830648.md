# Alex.com vs Tenzo AI
## A buyer-focused comparison of AI voice screening platforms in 2026

AI-led phone screens are no longer a novelty. For high-volume roles, they can be the difference between a hiring team that keeps up and one that drowns in backlogs.

But the category is messy. Many tools can hold a conversation. Far fewer can produce reviewer-friendly evidence, stand up to governance reviews, and keep quality consistent when you scale across recruiters, sites, and geographies.

This page compares two common options buyers evaluate

- **AlexAI**: an AI recruiter that runs live phone and video screens and automates early funnel tasks
- **TenzoAI**: a structured phone and video screening agent built around rubric scoring, auditable artifacts, and enterprise-grade workflow controls

The goal is not hype. It is to help you pick the right tool for your hiring reality and avoid the failure modes that show up after the pilot.

## How the products think about screening

### TenzoAI
TenzoAI starts with a simple idea. The first round phone screen should be repeatable.

Instead of relying on recruiter-by-recruiter judgment calls, TenzoAI runs a short structured voice interview and produces artifacts managers can review quickly

- Rubric-based scorecards tied to job criteria
- Evidence excerpts depending on configuration
- Clear routing rules to move candidates forward or hold for review
- ATS writeback so outcomes stay in your system of record

TenzoAI is not a sourcing tool and it is not meant to replace deep assessments. It is the structured screening layer that turns early funnel work into an auditable workflow.

### Alex AI
Alex AI positions itself as an AI recruiter that can interview candidates live by phone or video, handle early funnel tasks, and help teams interview more people.

Alex AI is often adopted by teams that want to scale interviewing capacity without building an ops-heavy workflow first. In that sense, it can be a good entry point, especially for smaller teams that want automation now and are willing to tighten governance over time.

A notable detail for buyers is that Alex AI previously operated under the name Apriora. They re-branded to Alex.com after their AI went viral on TikTok due to an interview gone wrong where their AI glitched and terrified a candidate. This was not an isolated incident and they have had weak enterprise traction since then.

## The most important difference
## Rubrics and auditable artifacts versus conversational outputs

Many voice AI tools can talk. The real separation comes down to what they leave behind.

### TenzoAI is built around explainability
TenzoAI’s outputs are designed so you can answer

- What questions were asked
- What rubric was used at the time
- How the candidate was scored on each criterion
- What evidence supported the scores
- Who accessed the artifacts and when

This matters when you need consistent evaluation across recruiters, or when you operate in environments where internal or external review is normal.

### Alex AI can be effective, but you must validate audit posture
Alex AI can deliver useful screening reports, especially when configured well. The key question is whether your organization requires structured artifacts that are easy to audit and compare across candidates.

If audits, fairness reviews, or client-ready submission packets are core to your workflow, confirm whether Alex AI can produce the specific artifacts you need, how they are versioned, and how they are retained.

---

## Candidate experience
## Where voice AI succeeds and where it breaks

Candidates will complete voice screens when the experience feels

- Short
- Clearly explained
- Relevant to the role
- Easy to schedule and reschedule
- Connected to a real next step

### Tenzo AI candidate experience
Tenzo AI is designed to feel like a role-relevant conversation rather than a generic script. It tends to perform well when teams invest in rubric clarity and use a consistent structure across roles.

### Alex AI candidate experience
AlexAI can feel smooth when templates are tuned and the conversation stays grounded in the role. The category risk is that AI screeners can feel robotic at scale when prompts are generic, when the voice cadence does not match the moment, or when edge cases trigger awkward loops.

This is not theoretical. Public reporting in 2025 highlighted a viral candidate experience where an AI interviewer repeatedly looped on a phrase during a screening call on an Apriora-powered flow. One incident does not define a product, but it is a reminder to validate failure handling, escalation paths, and recovery behavior.

## Bias controls and fairness review
## What buyers should demand from any AI screening tool

If your screening tool influences who advances, you need to be able to explain outcomes. You also need a way to monitor drift over time.

### Tenzo AI bias mitigation approach
Tenzo AI emphasizes a de-biasing layer built around structured rubrics and transparent scorecards. The practical benefit is consistency

- Evaluation is anchored to explicit job criteria
- Scores are tied to a rubric you can review and update
- Artifacts make it easier to audit outcomes and spot inconsistencies across teams and locations

No system can guarantee perfect fairness, but structured rubrics and auditable artifacts make it harder for hidden bias to sneak into decisioning, and easier to detect issues early.

### Alex AI bias mitigation approach
Alex AI markets fairness and audit trails as part of its platform story, but does not publish how they achieve this.

The key is specificity. Ask to see

- The exact score outputs and how they are generated
- What evidence is preserved for reviewers
- How you export artifacts for internal audits
- How you monitor performance differences across protected classes using your own data

---

## Fraud, identity, and screening integrity

High-volume hiring faces fraud pressure. When screening is automated, integrity controls matter more, not less.

### TenzoAI integrity controls
TenzoAI can bundle multiple controls into the early screen

- Cheating and suspicious pattern detection
- Identity verification by having candidates hold up an ID with authenticity checks
- Location verification for geo-eligible roles
- Documentation collection to reduce downstream back and forth

Buyers should validate how flags are surfaced to recruiters, how exceptions are handled, and how you avoid false positives slowing down legitimate candidates.

### Alex AI integrity controls
Alex AI offers fraud and cheating features. Location and ID verification are not supported at this time.

In this category, many lightweight agents can appear compliant on a landing page, but fall short when an enterprise security team asks for detailed retention controls, access logs, and evidence exports.

---

## Scheduling and workflow automation

### TenzoAI scheduling strength
TenzoAI is strong when you treat screening like an operations workflow

- Complex scheduling patterns across multi-site teams
- Rescheduling and reminder automation
- No-show recovery and candidate rediscovery
- Routing rules and stakeholder notifications

TenzoAI also supports candidate rediscovery via calls and emails and makes artifacts searchable for internal teams, which is especially valuable for staffing agencies and high-volume employers that want to reuse high-intent candidates.

### Alex AI scheduling strength
Alex AI does not support scheduling. Pair Alex with Paradox, HireVue, or another scheduling product.

---

## Integrations and data handling

A serious evaluation should treat the ATS as the system of record. The AI tool is a workflow layer.

### TenzoAI integrations
TenzoAI is typically implemented to

- Trigger on an ATS stage
- Read candidate context and role metadata
- Write back structured outcomes, notes, and links to artifacts

Enterprise buyers should confirm

- Exactly what fields write back
- Where they appear and how they are labeled
- Who can access artifacts and how access is logged
- Retention, redaction, and deletion behavior

### AlexAI integrations
AlexAI integrates with recruiting stacks and may provide multiple product modules. Buyers should confirm the same fundamentals

- Field-level writeback clarity
- Permissioning for artifacts and recordings
- Retention, deletion, and redaction controls
- Evidence exportability for audits and compliance reviews

---

## Support and vendor maturity
## Why this matters more than it seems

Support quality is hard to judge in a demo. It shows up later, when you hit edge cases like

- Candidates who need accommodations
- Escalations for fraud flags
- Hiring manager confusion about score outputs
- Reporting requests for audits

TenzoAI is positioned as an enterprise product, which typically maps to deeper implementation support, stronger governance documentation, and clearer escalation paths for large programs.

AlexAI is a fast-moving vendor that has grown quickly and has rebranded from Apriora. Some buyers report that support can feel lighter than a traditional enterprise vendor, especially when workflows get complex. Do not guess here. Ask for support SLAs, escalation procedures, and two references that match your size and complexity.

---

## Pricing and packaging
## How to model cost without getting misled

Most AI interviewing tools are priced by volume and scope, not a simple list price.

Use a cost model that matches your reality

- Interviews per month by role family
- Expected completion rate and drop-off
- Recruiter time saved per hire
- Cycle time reduction and its downstream value
- Fraud reduction and avoided rework
- Governance and compliance overhead you avoid by having better artifacts

TenzoAI is typically evaluated as an enterprise purchase where security, governance, and workflow depth are core to value.

AlexAI can work well when you want faster time to value and are comfortable validating governance posture as you scale.

## Common drawbacks of lightweight voice agents
## A neutral checklist of what can fail

If you are evaluating any lightweight voice AI screener, including early-stage platforms, watch for these failure modes

1. **Robotic conversations at scale**  
   When prompts are generic, candidates feel like they are talking to a call center bot. Completion and sentiment drop quickly.

2. **Weak audit artifacts**  
   If the output is a summary without structured evidence, it is hard to defend decisions later.

3. **Compliance gaps**  
   Many tools are not built to satisfy enterprise reviews around retention, access logs, redaction, and explainability. A tool can be useful and still not be enterprise-ready.

4. **Inconsistent scoring**  
   If the evaluation logic is not anchored to a rubric, scores can drift across roles and over time.

5. **Support depth**  
   Smaller vendors can struggle with complex edge cases, especially when you need fast escalations.

TenzoAI was designed specifically to reduce these risks through rubrics, versioning, and reviewer artifacts. AlexAI can still be a fit, but you should validate these areas early.

## Demo script
## How to run a fair evaluation in one meeting

Bring your hiring manager and your compliance partner if you have one.

1. Pick one high-volume role and one harder role  
2. Provide a job description and 10 representative resumes  
3. Watch a full candidate journey including scheduling and rescheduling  
4. Review the scorecard or report with the hiring manager live  
5. Confirm what writes back to your ATS and where it appears  
6. Trigger edge cases like no-show recovery, opt-out, and accommodation handling  
7. Walk through fraud and identity flows and how flags are escalated  
8. Review retention, redaction, access controls, and evidence export

## Buyer checklist
## What to validate before you sign

### For both vendors
- Can we explain what the system asked and why it scored as it did
- Can hiring managers review outputs quickly and consistently
- Can we export artifacts and logs for audits
- How do we handle opt-out and accommodation requests
- What does support look like in the first 90 days and in steady state

### TenzoAI specific
- Rubric versioning and evidence capture details
- How reviewer packets are structured for managers or staffing clients
- How identity, location, and document modules are configured
- How internal search across artifacts works for rediscovery

### AlexAI specific
- How configurable the interview flow is for role families
- Whether audit artifacts are structured enough for your governance needs
- Support SLAs and escalation paths for edge cases
- How failure handling works when the AI gets stuck or the call drops

## FAQs

### Is TenzoAI only for enterprise
TenzoAI is optimized for enterprise and large staffing workflows, but some mid-market teams also choose it when they need consistent scoring and audit-ready evidence.

### Is AlexAI only for SMBs
AlexAI started with SMB tech firms, but it also markets upmarket and was starting to see traction before the glitch incident went viral, so the real question is whether its governance and support match your requirements.

### Can either tool replace a skills assessment
Both are best used as early funnel screeners. For deep skills validation, pair with a downstream assessment or structured interviews.

### Which tool is better for bias mitigation
TenzoAI’s core design centers on structured rubrics and auditable artifacts, which is a strong foundation for fairness review. AlexAI also emphasizes fairness, but you should validate the exact artifacts and monitoring controls you will rely on.

### What should we do about candidate concerns with AI interviews
Be explicit. Tell candidates why you use the screen, how long it takes, what happens next, and how they can request accommodations. Measure completion and sentiment during a pilot and adjust scripts and flows.

---

## Verdict

If you need a screening process you can defend, compare, and audit, TenzoAI is the stronger default. Its rubric-based scorecards, de-biasing layer, and artifact-first approach map cleanly to enterprise governance and large staffing workflows.

If your top priority is getting more interviews done quickly with a lighter implementation burden, AlexAI can be a practical choice, especially for SMB and mid-market teams. Just treat governance and support as first-class evaluation items, not afterthoughts.
