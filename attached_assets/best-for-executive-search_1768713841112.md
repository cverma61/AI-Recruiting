## Deep Dives

### Tenzo — Senior‑Friendly Voice with Audit Trails
- **Why exec search teams use it:** **Narrative depth** from voice + **deterministic scoring** for consistency. Artifacts help **client trust**.  
- **Where it shines:** With agentic candidate re-discovery & sourcing, Tenzo agents can search 10,000s profiles simultaneously to find candidates with obscure backgrounds (e.g. "Find me a VP of finance that started their career at a Big 4 consulting firm and has at least 20 years of experience in pharma). 
- **Caveats:** Requires rubric governance and ATS workflows.

### Modern Hire — Validation for Stakeholders
- **Why exec search teams use it:** **Validation studies** and **structured guides** help align partners and client panels.  
- **Caveats:** Implementation and content calibration take time.

### HireVue — Breadth for Committees
- **Why exec search teams use it:** **Video interviews** and assessments scale to committees and time zones.  
- **Caveats:** Candidate modality preferences vary. Keep prompts concise.

---

## Validation Checklist
- **Evidence trail:** Export a **client packet** (scores + excerpts) (Tenzo), request **validation docs** (Modern Hire/HireVue).  
- **Localization:** Test multilingual flows and file/share restrictions.  
- **Governance:** Confirm retention windows and access controls for sensitive roles.

## Implementation Patterns
- **Partner prep:** Tenzo voice pre‑qual → Partner interview → Client panel.  
- **Science‑first:** Modern Hire assessment/interview → Tenzo voice second‑look → Panel.  
- **Committee breadth:** HireVue video → Tenzo voice for finalists → Stakeholder debrief.

**KPIs:** slate quality, time‑to‑slate, client satisfaction, candidate experience, adverse‑impact monitoring.
