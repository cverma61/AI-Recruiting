# Purplefish Review (2026): AI Phone Screens for High Volume Hiring

Purplefish is a voice screening platform designed to automate first round phone screens and push the results back into your ATS. It is typically evaluated by staffing and talent teams that want to reduce time spent on repetitive screening calls while keeping recruiters working inside their system of record.

This review focuses on what Purplefish does well, where buyers should be realistic, and what to validate in a demo and pilot. It also includes common alternatives for teams that need more structured scoring and stronger audit artifacts.

## What Purplefish is and is not

### What Purplefish is
Purplefish runs AI phone screens and creates a consistent record of the interaction that recruiters can review later.

Most buyers look for:
- Faster screening throughput without expanding recruiter headcount
- Coverage outside business hours
- A consistent record in the ATS, including transcripts and outcomes
- Less manual note taking and status updates

### What Purplefish is not
Purplefish is not a full recruiting suite and it is not a replacement for downstream, job specific assessments.

- Not a sourcing engine
- Not a full talent suite replacing your ATS
- Not a deep skills assessment platform for hard skill validation

---

## Who Purplefish fits best

Purplefish tends to be most attractive when cost, speed, and workflow fit are the primary decision drivers.

### Best fit scenarios
- SMB and mid-market staffing agencies running many screens per-week
- Lean TA teams that need to scale screening without adding coordinators
- Teams that want screening artifacts to land directly in the ATS
- Programs that want a straightforward screening layer with minimal process redesign

### When Purplefish may be the wrong fit
- Regulated or compliance sensitive environments that require audit ready scoring artifacts
- Programs where structured, rubric based scoring is a hard requirement
- Hiring funnels with fraud pressure that require identity checks, location verification, or document collection during screening
- Organizations that need complex scheduling and rediscovery workflows as part of the same product
- Organizations that need high engagement and strong candidate experience

Purplefish can still be considered in these environments, but the burden shifts to careful validation and additional process design.

---

## How Purplefish works end to end

A typical flow looks like this.

1. Trigger in your ATS  
   A candidate reaches a stage such as phone screen

2. Candidate outreach  
   Purplefish contacts the candidate and guides them into the phone screen

3. AI phone screen  
   Purplefish conducts a short screening conversation based on your configuration

4. Artifacts and writeback  
   Purplefish writes outcomes back to the ATS, typically including a transcript and screening results

5. Recruiter review and next step  
   Recruiters review the record and route candidates forward

---

## Core capabilities

### AI phone screens that reduce recruiter load
Purplefish is built to remove the phone screen bottleneck. For many staffing teams, this is the highest leverage automation because it frees recruiters to focus on sourcing, client communication, and closing.

What to validate:
- How the agent handles off script answers
- How it recovers from interruptions and poor call quality
- How it handles candidate questions and clarifications

### Configurable screening questions
Most buyers need screens that map to role requirements, client preferences, and deal breakers.

What to validate:
- How you author and update question sets
- Whether you can support different screens by role family or client
- How changes are versioned over time

### Reporting for throughput and conversion
To manage a screening program, you need visibility.

What to validate:
- Completion rate and drop off by step
- Time to complete and time to review
- Pass through rate and downstream quality signals
- Exception rate, including how often recruiters must step in

---

## ATS integrations and data flow

The reason many teams adopt a voice screening tool is not the conversation. It is the record.

### Transcript and outcome writeback
Purplefish is typically evaluated on how well it keeps recruiters in the ATS. Strong writeback reduces tool switching, improves adoption, and creates a clean audit trail for internal reviews.

What to validate:
- Exactly where transcripts and outcomes are stored in your ATS
- Who can see those artifacts and how access is controlled
- How long artifacts are retained and how deletion requests are handled
- What happens when a sync fails

### Multi-client and multi-workflow setups
Staffing agencies often run many workflows across clients. Validate whether Purplefish supports configuration patterns that match your operating model.

---

## Candidate experience

Voice screening only works if candidates complete it. The category has a shared risk: if the experience feels robotic, repetitive, or confusing, completion drops.

Purplefish tends to work best when:
- The screen is short and role relevant
- The purpose and next steps are explained clearly at the start
- Candidates have an easy way to reschedule or retry if the call fails
- The agent can handle natural speech without forcing strict phrasing

What to validate in a pilot:
- Completion rate by role and candidate segment
- Candidate sentiment and complaint themes
- Average call duration and abandonment points
- Whether recruiters need to manually rescue a meaningful share of screens

---

## Governance, audits, and bias controls

This is where many buyers discover they are comparing two different product philosophies.

### What most SMB and mid market teams need
Many SMB teams primarily need:
- A consistent record of what was asked and answered
- A usable outcome signal that recruiters can review quickly
- Basic controls over retention and access

### What enterprise and audit heavy teams often require
Enterprise buyers often require:
- Transparent rubric scoring tied to explicit job criteria
- Versioned rubrics so you can show what criteria applied at the time
- Auditable artifacts that explain how an outcome was reached
- Governance workflows that support fairness review and internal audits

Purplefish can be a fit for enterprise programs, but you should validate the full chain from screen to scoring to artifacts to reviewer access logging. If your compliance team expects an evidenced based model and audit packets, evaluate Tenzo AI alongside Purplefish.

---

## Implementation and change management

Purplefish is often adopted because it can fit into existing ATS workflows. Even so, strong outcomes still require ownership.

A practical rollout plan:
- Start with 1 to 3 high volume roles
- Define a simple pass through policy and escalation path for edge cases
- Map ATS stages and writeback fields clearly
- Train recruiters on how to interpret artifacts consistently
- Pilot, measure, then expand role coverage

---

## Pricing and packaging

Pricing is usually tied to volume and scope rather than a single list price.

Common drivers:
- Number of screens per month
- Number of roles, clients, or workflows supported
- ATS integration scope and any custom data mappings
- Reporting requirements
- Support tier and implementation services

How to model ROI:
- Recruiter hours saved per week
- Time to qualified shortlist
- Speed to submit for staffing
- Fill rate and quality signals downstream

---

## Limitations and tradeoffs

### Explainability may require extra work
Transcripts are helpful, but transcripts alone do not guarantee explainability. If you need to explain decisions in a structured way, validate whether you get transparent criteria and consistent scoring outputs.

### Audit readiness is not a default state
If you must pass audits, confirm that your artifacts, retention policy, access logging, and scoring logic meet your internal standards.

### Fraud controls may sit outside the product
If identity checks, location verification, or document collection are requirements, validate whether Purplefish supports them directly or whether you will add a separate step.

### Support depth varies by plan
Many products offer different support experiences by tier. If your hiring operation runs nights and weekends, confirm response time targets and escalation paths for those hours.

## Alternatives to Purplefish

Purplefish is a solid option for teams focused on automating phone screens and writing results back into the ATS. If your priorities differ, these alternatives may fit better.

## Demo script and buyer checklist

Use the same evaluation flow for every vendor so you can compare consistently.

### Demo script
1. Pick one high volume role and one complex role  
2. Provide a job description and 10 representative resumes  
3. Run a live screen end to end  
4. Review what is written back into your ATS and where it appears  
5. Test edge cases like opt out, language switching, and poor call quality  
6. Review reporting for completion, drop off, and pass through rates  
7. Walk through retention, access controls, and logging  
8. Ask for the support model, response targets, and escalation paths  

### Buyer checklist
- Does the experience stay clear and role relevant
- Can recruiters review outcomes quickly inside the ATS
- Can you explain outcomes in a defensible way for your environment
- Do artifacts and controls match your governance expectations
- Can your team operate without constant manual exceptions
- Does support coverage match your hiring hours

## FAQs

### Is Purplefish a good fit for staffing agencies
It can be, especially when phone screens are the primary bottleneck and the agency wants artifacts to land in the ATS. The best results come when the screen is tightly scoped and tied to downstream steps.

### Will candidates accept AI phone screens
Many candidates will if the experience is short, clear, and leads to fast next steps. The biggest risk is a robotic or confusing interaction, so pilot with real candidates before scaling.

### Do we still need recruiters to review outcomes
Yes. Voice AI can standardize and speed the first step, but humans still own hiring decisions. The product should make review faster and more consistent, not remove accountability.

### How do we reduce risk in a rollout
Start with a limited pilot. Define success metrics in advance, including completion, recruiter time saved, and downstream quality. Scale role by role only after the workflow is stable.

## Verdict

Purplefish is a strong option for SMB and mid market teams that want to automate phone screens and push transcripts and outcomes back into the ATS. It fits best when your goal is faster throughput and less recruiter time spent on repetitive screens.

If you need structured rubric scoring, a de-biasing layer with transparent scorecards, and audit friendly artifacts designed for compliance and fairness review, Tenzo AI is the most relevant alternative to evaluate alongside Purplefish.
