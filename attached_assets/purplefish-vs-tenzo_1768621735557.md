# Purplefish vs Tenzo AI (2026): Which Voice Screening Platform Fits Your Hiring Workflow

If you are evaluating voice AI for recruiting, the real question is not whether an agent can hold a conversation. The question is what happens after the conversation.

Can your team review outcomes fast  
Can managers trust what they see  
Can you explain how decisions were made  
Can you pass audits without rebuilding your process

Purplefish and Tenzo AI both target high volume screening, but they are optimized for different buyer priorities. Purplefish leans into ultra realistic voice screening plus wide ATS coverage. Tenzo AI leans into structured evaluation with rubric based outputs, de-biasing controls, and audit friendly artifacts. Tenzo also layers in fraud and identity controls that many teams now want in the very first step of the funnel.

## Quick verdict

### Choose TenzoAI if you need defensible screening at scale
Tenzo AI is the better fit when consistency and audit readiness matter as much as speed.

Best for:
- Enterprise TA teams with compliance, governance, or fairness review needs
- Large staffing agencies that build client ready submission packets
- High volume hourly programs where fraud and identity controls matter
- Multi location programs with complex scheduling and rediscovery needs

### Choose Purplefish if your top priority is voice screening automation with broad ATS coverage
Purplefish can be a strong fit if you want a realistic voice agent that plugs into many recruiting systems and you want screening to run 24x7 with minimal workflow disruption.

Best for:
- Staffing and recruiting teams that want to remove the phone screen bottleneck quickly
- Hiring teams that value voice realism and candidate experience consistency
- Programs that want two way ATS sync and automatic transcript writeback

---

## What both tools do well

Both platforms are built around the same core promise.

- Automate first round phone screens
- Engage candidates quickly and at any hour
- Produce artifacts like transcripts and screening outcomes
- Sync results back into your ATS so recruiters stay in the system of record
- Reduce recruiter time spent on repetitive screening calls

The differences show up in how structured the evaluation is, how explainable the output is, and how far each platform goes on enterprise governance and fraud controls.

## The biggest differences that change buying decisions

### 1. Structured scoring versus conversational outcomes
**Tenzo AI** is built around structured, humanlike voice screens that map to a rubric. Reviewers get transparent scorecards tied to explicit criteria, with artifacts that support audit and fairness review.

**Purplefish** emphasizes simple voice interactions and fast screening at scale, with transcripts and results syncing back to the ATS.

Buyer takeaway: if you need consistency across recruiters, regions, and managers, TenzoAI’s rubric first design is usually easier to standardize.

### 2. Audit readiness and explainability
Many voice AI tools can generate summaries. Fewer can support a clean audit trail.

**TenzoAI** is designed to help you explain what was asked, how it was scored, and what evidence supported the score. The value is not only speed. It is a defensible process.

**Purplefish** focuses on SMB's and mid-market buyers who don't need the same level of compliance guarantees but prefer a less expensive product as a result.

Buyer takeaway: match to your company's compliance needs and price point.

### 3. Bias controls and ongoing fairness governance
**Tenzo AI** emphasizes a de-biasing layer that keeps evaluation tied to job relevant criteria through transparent, rubric based scorecards. The goal is to reduce the risk of bias creeping into screening through vague model scoring or inconsistent human interpretation.

**Purplefish** highlights fairness and transparency messaging and references external bias auditing efforts. Buyers should still validate how screening criteria are defined, versioned, and reviewed over time.

Buyer takeaway: the best bias mitigation is repeatable structure plus reviewable artifacts, not only a promise that the model is fair.

### 4. Fraud, identity, and eligibility controls
This is where TenzoAI differentiates most clearly.

**Tenzo AI** can flag suspicious behaviors during screening, verify candidate identity through ID checks, verify candidate location, and collect required documentation early. That matters for programs with fraud pressure and compliance gating.

**Purplefish** focuses primarily on phone screening automation. If fraud and identity verification are requirements for your program, we suggest you look elsewhere.

Buyer takeaway: if fraud controls are on your 2026 roadmap, choose a platform that supports them in the same workflow as screening.

### 5. Scheduling complexity and rediscovery workflows
**Tenzo AI** is strong when screening is part of a larger operational workflow. It supports complex scheduling patterns and can handle candidate rediscovery through phone and email outreach. It also supports internal search across past artifacts so teams can reuse high intent candidates.

**Purplefish** does not currently support scheduling workflows.

Buyer takeaway: high volume hiring is an operations problem. You will get more value if your screening layer can run the workflow, not just the conversation.

## How the candidate experience differs

Candidate experience is the hidden conversion lever in voice screening. Completion rates can swing dramatically based on tone, clarity, and friction.

### Tenzo AI candidate experience
TenzoAI is designed to feel like a short, role relevant conversation with clear expectations. The biggest candidate experience win is reducing confusion about what is being evaluated. Candidates can be assessed against explicit criteria rather than ambiguous impressions.

### Purplefish candidate experience
Purplefish leans into a phone AI voice experience and consistent delivery across candidates. Some candidates due complain that due to the less expensive models used, the voice feels robotic.

What to validate in a pilot:
- Completion rate
- Drop off by step
- Average time to complete
- Candidate sentiment by segment and role type
- Re engagement effectiveness after a missed screen

## Enterprise readiness and compliance questions to ask

If you are in a regulated environment, or you simply expect audits, treat these as required questions for both vendors.

### Artifacts and audit trail
- What artifacts are produced for every screen
- How scoring is explained to a reviewer
- Whether rubric versions are stored and retrievable
- Whether reviewer access is logged
- How long transcripts, audio, and derived outputs are retained

### Data handling and privacy
- What data is stored, where it is stored, and how it is encrypted
- Whether data is used to train models and under what conditions
- How data subject requests are handled
- How redaction works for sensitive information

### Bias governance and monitoring
- How job criteria are defined and approved
- Whether protected class proxies are handled or suppressed in scoring
- How drift is detected when roles or labor markets change
- What ongoing reporting exists for fairness review

---

## Support and implementation reality check

It is easy to underestimate the operational work behind voice screening.

### Tenzo AI implementation effort
Tenzo AI tends to deliver the most value when you treat rollout as an operations project.

- Define rubrics for each role family
- Tune questions, thresholds, and exception workflows
- Map ATS stages and writeback fields
- Train recruiters and managers to review scorecards consistently

The upside is a cleaner, more defensible process that scales across teams.

### Purplefish implementation effort
Purplefish emphasizes integration, two way sync, and fast activation for phone screening. Many teams value a deployment that minimizes workflow changes. Still, you should validate how much customization is required to get a strong signal and how changes are managed over time.

### About support
I cannot fairly claim that any vendor has good or bad support without consistent, verifiable buyer evidence. What you can do is de risk it.

Support due diligence checklist:
- Ask for response time targets by severity
- Ask what escalation looks like on weekends and nights
- Confirm whether you get a dedicated support contact at your plan level
- Ask for references that match your hiring volume and ATS

This matters even more for newer vendors with smaller teams, where support capacity can vary based on growth and customer load.

## Common pitfalls with voice AI screening tools

Buyers often discover these issues only after rollout.

### Robotic interactions at scale
Even strong demos can degrade in the wild when candidates go off script, network conditions are poor, or the agent cannot recover gracefully. Validate real world conversations, not only curated recordings.

### Weak governance and audit artifacts
Some tools stop at a summary and a single score. That can be risky for enterprise adoption. If you cannot explain outcomes with role tied criteria and a clear evidence trail, you will struggle with stakeholder trust and audits.

### Compliance ambiguity
Teams sometimes assume a vendor is compliant because it sounds modern. Compliance is not a vibe. It is controls, documentation, and repeatability. Get the security docs early and make compliance part of the pilot exit criteria.

TenzoAI’s product philosophy is designed specifically to avoid these traps by focusing on structured rubrics, transparent scorecards, and auditable artifacts.

## FAQs

### Is voice AI screening safe to deploy in enterprise hiring
Yes, if you treat it as part of your hiring system of record, not a standalone bot. The key is governance, explainability, and retention controls. A structured rubric with auditable artifacts is the simplest path to defensible adoption.

### Will candidates dislike AI phone screens
Some will, especially if the experience feels robotic or confusing. Completion is highest when the screen is short, role relevant, clearly explained, and leads to fast outcomes.

### Can either tool replace recruiter judgment
No. The best deployments use automation for consistency and throughput while keeping humans accountable for decisions. The platform should help humans make better decisions faster, not outsource accountability.

### How do I quantify ROI
Model a pilot against a few metrics:
- Recruiter hours saved per requisition
- Time to qualified shortlist
- Time to fill reduction
- Candidate completion and pass through rates
- Manager review time per candidate
