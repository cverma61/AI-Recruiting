# Glossary of AI Recruiting Terms (2026 Edition)

AI recruiting is full of overloaded language. Vendors use the same words to mean very different things. This glossary translates common terms into concrete, testable definitions so buyers can compare products without getting trapped in buzzwords.

## How to use this glossary
- Use it as a reference while you evaluate tools, run pilots, and read product comparisons
- When a term sounds impressive, ask the vendor to show you where it lives in the product and what it produces
- For high stakes roles or regulated environments, involve counsel and qualified industrial organizational experts

## What good looks like in 2026
Modern platforms are expected to produce audit friendly artifacts, support accessibility, and operate with clear controls around privacy, fairness, and security. If a vendor cannot explain how a decision was made, cannot reproduce outcomes, or cannot export evidence, treat that as a material risk.

## Common pitfalls buyers should watch for
Some conversational and voice agents sound polished in a demo but struggle in production. The most common gaps are a robotic candidate experience, inconsistent scoring, limited auditability, weak escalation paths, and unclear compliance posture. If the system cannot generate auditable artifacts for each step and cannot provide a clear policy and logging model, it is not enterprise ready.

## Short buyer checklist
Use these questions to force clarity in vendor conversations.

1. What artifacts can you export for each candidate and each stage, including transcripts, scorecards, and logs
2. Can you reproduce scoring for a candidate if you rerun the workflow with the same inputs and versioned settings
3. How do you detect and respond to drift, and how do you monitor fairness over time
4. What accessibility standards do you support, and can candidates request accommodations
5. What is your security posture, including tenant isolation, encryption, retention, and subprocessor controls
6. How do you handle fraud risks, including identity verification, location verification, and cheating detection
7. What does handoff look like when candidates need a human, and what are your SLAs
