      title: "What Purplefish is and is not",
      content: `### What Purplefish is
Purplefish runs AI phone screens and creates a consistent record of the interaction that recruiters can review later.

Most buyers look for:
- Faster screening throughput without expanding recruiter headcount
- Coverage outside business hours
- A consistent record in the ATS, including transcripts and outcomes
- Less manual note taking and status updates

### What Purplefish is not
Purplefish is not a full recruiting suite and it is not a replacement for downstream, job specific assessments.

- Not a sourcing engine
- Not a full talent suite replacing your ATS
- Not a deep skills assessment platform for hard skill validation`

    {
      id: "who-fits-best",
      title: "Who Purplefish fits best",
      content: `Purplefish tends to be most attractive when cost, speed, and workflow fit are the primary decision drivers.

### Best fit scenarios
- SMB and mid-market staffing agencies running many screens per-week
- Lean TA teams that need to scale screening without adding coordinators
- Teams that want screening artifacts to land directly in the ATS
- Programs that want a straightforward screening layer with minimal process redesign

### When Purplefish may be the wrong fit
- Regulated or compliance sensitive environments that require audit ready scoring artifacts
- Programs where structured, rubric based scoring is a hard requirement
- Hiring funnels with fraud pressure that require identity checks, location verification, or document collection during screening
- Organizations that need complex scheduling and rediscovery workflows as part of the same product
- Organizations that need high engagement and strong candidate experience`

      id: "how-it-works",
      title: "How Purplefish works end to end",
      content: `A typical flow looks like this:

1. **Trigger in your ATS**  
   A candidate reaches a stage such as phone screen

2. **Candidate outreach**  
   Purplefish contacts the candidate and guides them into the phone screen

3. **AI phone screen**  
   Purplefish conducts a short screening conversation based on your configuration

4. **Artifacts and writeback**  
   Purplefish writes outcomes back to the ATS, typically including a transcript and screening results

5. **Recruiter review and next step**  
   Recruiters review the record and route candidates forward`

      title: "Core capabilities",
      content: `### AI phone screens that reduce recruiter load
Purplefish is built to remove the phone screen bottleneck. For many staffing teams, this is the highest leverage automation because it frees recruiters to focus on sourcing, client communication, and closing.

### Configurable screening questions
Most buyers need screens that map to role requirements, client preferences, and deal breakers. You can author and update question sets and support different screens by role family or client.

### Reporting for throughput and conversion
To manage a screening program, you need visibility into:
- Completion rate and drop off by step
- Time to complete and time to review
- Pass through rate and downstream quality signals`

      id: "ats-integration",
      title: "ATS integrations and data flow",
      content: `### Transcript and outcome writeback
Strong writeback reduces tool switching, improves adoption, and creates a clean audit trail.

**What to validate:**
- Exactly where transcripts and outcomes are stored in your ATS
- Who can see those artifacts and how access is controlled
- How long artifacts are retained and how deletion requests are handled

### Multi-client and multi-workflow setups
Staffing agencies often run many workflows across clients. Purplefish supports configuration patterns that match these complex operating models.`

      id: "candidate-experience",
      title: "Candidate experience",
      content: `Voice screening only works if candidates complete it. Purplefish tends to work best when:
- The screen is short and role relevant
- The purpose and next steps are explained clearly at the start
- Candidates have an easy way to reschedule or retry if the call fails
- The agent can handle natural speech without forcing strict phrasing`

      content: `### What most SMB and mid market teams need
Many SMB teams primarily need:
- A consistent record of what was asked and answered
- A usable outcome signal that recruiters can review quickly
- Basic controls over retention and access

### What enterprise and audit heavy teams often require
Enterprise buyers often require:
- Transparent rubric scoring tied to explicit job criteria
- Versioned rubrics so you can show what criteria applied at the time
- Auditable artifacts that explain how an outcome was reached`

- Start with 1 to 3 high volume roles
- Define a simple pass through policy and escalation path for edge cases
- Map ATS stages and writeback fields clearly
- Train recruiters on how to interpret artifacts consistently

- Number of screens per month
- Number of roles, clients, or workflows supported
- ATS integration scope and any custom data mappings

**How to model ROI:**
- Recruiter hours saved per week
- Time to qualified shortlist
- Speed to submit for staffing`

- **Audit readiness is not a default state**: Confirm artifacts match your internal standards.
- **Fraud controls may sit outside the product**: Identity checks may require a separate step.
- **Support depth varies by plan**: Confirm response targets for nights and weekends.`

      id: "faqs",
      title: "FAQs",
      content: `### Is Purplefish a good fit for staffing agencies?
It can be, especially when phone screens are the primary bottleneck and the agency wants artifacts to land in the ATS. The best results come when the screen is tightly scoped and tied to downstream steps.

### Will candidates accept AI phone screens?
Voice screening only works if candidates complete it. Purplefish tends to work best when the screen is short and role relevant. Completion rate is a key metric to validate in a pilot.`
