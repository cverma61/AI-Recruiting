    score: 8.5,
    summary: "Purplefish is a strong contender for staffing teams needing speed and ATS consistency. It sacrifices deep assessment depth for workflow efficiency and ease of use.",
    pros: [
      "Direct ATS writeback of transcripts and outcomes",
      "High throughput for screening calls",
      "Seamless candidate handoff",
      "Simple configuration for role-specific questions"
    ],
    cons: [
      "Limited assessment depth for complex roles",
      "Not a replacement for full structured interviews",
      "Reporting can be basic compared to enterprise suites"
    ]

      id: "what-is-it",
      title: "What Purplefish is and is not",
      content: `Purplefish runs AI phone screens and creates a consistent record of the interaction that recruiters can review later. Most buyers look for faster screening throughput without expanding recruiter headcount, coverage outside business hours, and a consistent record in the ATS. It is NOT a full recruiting suite or a deep skills assessment platform.`
    },
    {
      id: "best-fit",
      title: "Who Purplefish fits best",
      content: `Purplefish tends to be most attractive when cost, speed, and workflow fit are the primary decision drivers. It's a great fit for SMB and mid-market staffing agencies, lean TA teams, and programs needing screening artifacts in the ATS. It may be the wrong fit for highly regulated environments needing strict audit-ready scoring or complex fraud prevention.`
    },
    {
      id: "how-it-works",
      title: "How Purplefish works end to end",
      content: `The typical flow starts with a trigger in your ATS. Purplefish then contacts the candidate, guides them into an AI phone screen, conducts the conversation, and writes back artifacts (transcripts, results) to the ATS for recruiter review.`
    },
    {
      id: "core-capabilities",
      title: "Core capabilities",
      content: `Key capabilities include AI phone screens that reduce recruiter load, configurable screening questions mapped to role requirements, and reporting for throughput and conversion (completion rates, time to complete).`
    },
    {
      id: "ats-integration",
      title: "ATS integrations and data flow",
      content: `A major strength is the transcript and outcome writeback. Purplefish keeps recruiters in their system of record. It supports multi-client and multi-workflow setups common in staffing agencies.`
    },
    {
      id: "governance",
      title: "Governance, audits, and bias controls",
      content: `For SMBs, it provides consistent records and usable outcome signals. Enterprise buyers should validate if the rubric scoring and audit artifacts meet their specific compliance needs.`
    },
    {
      id: "pricing",
      title: "Pricing and packaging",
      content: `Pricing is typically volume-based (screens per month) and scope-based (number of roles/clients). ROI is modeled on recruiter hours saved and speed to submit.`
